"""
Module for implementing Lab 07 functions.

The first function first_vowel is a helper function of the second function
pigify (which is the primary function). Function pigify converts English words
to Pig-Latin.

IMPLEMENT both functions.

While you are encouraged to test your answers, you do not need to write a unit
test.
